# Captain Marvel :boom:

### Story :book:
Captain Marvel comes and saves the day (insert any day here) with her amazing display of feminism.

### Key Points :memo:
Feminism should not be forced upon into a story. The fact that superheroes regardless of the gender saves the day should, by itself, be considered a feminist victory.
